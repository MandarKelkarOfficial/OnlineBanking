## ðŸ¦® Accessibility


## ðŸŒ— Multi theme

It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, and some may say it is totally biased, but it uses the most simple theming plugin there is for it, [Tailwind Multi Theme plugin](https://github.com/estevanmaito/tailwindcss-multi-theme#tailwind-css-multi-theme). The result is that, as with regular Tailwind, you have control over every style in your pages.

You can see that by navigating through the examples, changing theme and going visiting pages like login or create account, to see different images served for different themes.

Theme auto detection based on user's OS preferences and local settings storage are enabled by default.
